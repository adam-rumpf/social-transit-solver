/**
Memory logger.

Reads and writes the TS/SA algorithm's memory structures from and to an output file. This allows the search process to be halted and resumed later.

Most of the memory structures associated with the search process are stored as public attributes of the main search's memory log object. The memory logger accesses these values via a pointer to the main search object.

The log file should always be automatically generated by this program and should never need to be viewed or edited by the user, but for reference its rows are arranged as follows:
	comment line to explain row structure
	tab-separated list of ADD tabu tenures for all solution vector elements
	tab-separated list of DROP tabu tenures for all solution vector elements
	tab-separated list representing current solution vector
	tab-separated list representing best known solution vector
	current objective value
	best known objective value
	current iteration number
	inner nonimprovement counter
	outer nonimprovement counter
	current tenure for new tabu moves
	current simulated annealing temperature
	tab-separated list of attractive solution objectives
	all remaining rows consist of tab-separated lists defining the attractive solution vectors, in the same order as the objectives in the above row

/**
Solution logger.

Records information about every solution encountered during the search process. This allows us to simply look up previously-generated solutions instead of having to reevaluate the objective and constraint functions.

Includes methods for reading from and writing to the solution log input and output files.

Due to the structure of the main solver's neighborhood search, we may occasionally generate the objective function value but not the constraint function value for a logged solution. For this reason, some rows in the solution log may be incomplete, but may be filled in later if the constraint function value is needed. Several of the methods of this class revolve around looking up or filling in pieces of information about solutions.

The most important attribute of this class is the solution log, which is an unordered map of solutions. The log is indexed by the string version of the corresponding solution vector. The entry in the log is a 5-part tuple consisting of the following:
	<0> the feasibility result
	<1> a vector of constraint function elements
	<2> the constraint evaluation time
	<3> the objective value
	<4> the objective evaluation time
