/**
Nonlinear cost assignment model evaluation for a given solution.

Requires a fleet size vector and an initial solution, which takes the form of a pair made up of a flow vector and a waiting time scalar.

Returns a pair containing a vector of flow values and a waiting time scalar.

The solution vector is used to determine the frequency and capacity of each line. Frequencies contribute to boarding arc costs for the common lines problem, while capacities contribute to an overcrowding penalty to model congestion.

The overall process being used here is the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which iteratively solves the linear approximation of the nonlinear cost quadratic program. That linear approximation happens to be an instance of the constant-cost LP whose costs are based on the current solution.

The Frank-Wolfe algorithm includes a means for bounding the absolute error of the current solution based on the objective values of the previous solutions.
