Constant-cost assignment model evaluation for a given solution.

Requires a fleet size vector and nonlinear cost vector.

Returns a pair containing a vector of flow values and a waiting time scalar.

This model comes from the linear program formulation of the common line problem, which can be solved using a Dijkstra-like label setting algorithm. This must be done separately for every sink node, but each of these problems is independent and may be parallelized. The final result is the sum of these individual results.

The flow vector and waiting time are passed by reference and automatically incremented according to the results of this function.

The algorithm here solves the constant-cost, single-destination version of the common lines problem, which is a LP similar to min-cost flow and is solvable with a Dijkstra-like label setting algorithm.

	To explain a few technical details, the label setting algorithm involves updating a distance label for each node. In each iteration, we choose the unprocessed arc with the minimum value of its own cost plus its head's label. In order to speed up that search, we store all of those values in a min-priority queue. As with Dijkstra's algorithm, to get around the inability to update priorities, we just add extra copies to the queue whenever they are updated. We also store a master list of those values, which should always decrease as the algorithm moves forward, as a comparison every time we pop something out of the queue to ensure that we have the latest version.

	The arc loading algorithm involves processing all of the selected attractive arcs in descending order of their cost-plus-head-label from the label setting algorithm. This is accomplished in a similar way, with a copy of the cost-plus-head-label being added to a max-priority queue each time the tail label is updated.
