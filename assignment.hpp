/**
Implementation of the nonlinear-cost Spiess and Florian user assignment model.

Solves the Spiess and Florian model to return the user flows based on a given solution. This involves conducting the Frank-Wolfe algorithm on the nonlinear model, which in turn involves iteratively solving the constant-cost version of the model.

Constant-cost assignment model class.

This could technically be used as an assignment model all on its own, but its main purpose is as a subroutine within the nonlinear model, which involves iteratively solving and re-solving the constant-cost model.
