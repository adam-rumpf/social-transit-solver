/**
A class for the network representation of the public transit system.

Its constructor reads the node and arc data files and uses them to define Node and Arc objects. Pointers to these objects are then stored in different lists, partitioned depending on their function, for use in the objective and constraint function calculations. Line and Vehicle lists are similarly generated.

Most of the network objects are partitioned into a "core" set which is used for all purposes (including stop/boarding nodes and line/boarding/alighting/walking arcs), and an "access" set which is only needed for the primary care access metrics (including population/facility nodes and their associated walking arcs). Only the core set needs to be considered for the constraint calculation, while the access sets must be added in for the objective.
