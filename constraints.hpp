Constraint function class.

A variety of local attributes are used to store information required for calculating the constraint functions

Methods are used to execute different steps of the constraint function calculation process, which in turn requires the use of the assignment model.

NOTE: Currently leaving out the operator cost function, since it is irrelevant to our model.
