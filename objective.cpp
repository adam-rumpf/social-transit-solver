	To explain some of the technical details, the standard C++ priority queue container does not easily allow changing the priorities of its entries. This makes the tentative distance reduction step of Dijkstra's algorithm more difficult since we cannot simply reduce priorities (distances) in the queue.
	
	As a workaround, whenever we need to reduce a tentative distance, we just add another copy of that node to the queue along with its new (smaller) distance value. Whenever we do this we also reduce that node's current distance in a distance vector.
	
	If we pop a node out of the queue and its distance matches the distance from the vector, then we must be looking at the most recent copy, which will also be the correct one. If they do not match, then we must be looking at an old copy, and we can ignore it.
